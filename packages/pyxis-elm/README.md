## Pyxis elm 

Pyxis-elm aims to be the library which is used by Prima to build UI components in Elm language.

_Disclaimer: we're aware that Elm doesn't have components but only modules. 
We will refer to components in order to keep consistency with pyxis-react._

### Get started

You can use pyxis-elm the same way you do with any other Elm package.
In your project run `elm install primait/pyxis-elm`.

Now you're ready to require components (Elm call them modules) from Pyxis-elm. 
Be aware that some components are _stateless_ and some others are _stateful_.

Be sure to reach out the documentation for each component in order to see an example and a full list of available api.
