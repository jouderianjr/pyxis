An accordion is a vertically stacked list of headers that reveal or hide associated sections of content.

                [ Html.text "Lorem ipsum." ]
            ]
    ]
```

## Opening Type
The accordion component has two different ways of managing the opening of its items.

### Single
The `single` type allows you to open only one item at a time.

<component with-label="Accordion" />
```
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { accordion = Accordion.init (Accordion.singleOpening Nothing)
    }
```

You can also open an item by passing its id.
<component with-label="Single Open" />
```
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { accordion = Accordion.init (Accordion.singleOpening (Just "first-id"))
    }
```

### Multiple
The `multiple` type allows you to open multiple items at the same time.

<component with-label="Multiple" />
```
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { accordion = Accordion.init (Accordion.multipleOpening [])
    }
```

You can also open one or more items, passing their ids.
<component with-label="Multiple Open" />
```
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { accordion = Accordion.init (Accordion.multipleOpening ["first-id", "second-id"])
    }
```

## Variant
The variants allow you to change the color scheme of the accordion.

### Light
<component with-label="Light" with-background="#F3F4F4" />
```
accordion : Html msg
accordion =
    Accordion.config accordionItems
        |> Accordion.withLightVariant
        |> Accordion.render Model.AccordionChanged model.accordion
```

## Theme
You can set your Accordion with a default _theme_ or alternative. Alt theme is mandatory in case of a dark background.

### Alternative
<component with-label="Alternative" with-background="#21283B" />
```
accordion : Html msg
accordion =
    Accordion.config accordionItems
        |> Accordion.withTheme Theme.alternative
        |> Accordion.render Model.AccordionChanged model.accordion
```

## Accordion Item
The accordion item must necessarily have a title and a content, but it also allows you to insert some more content.


### Subtitle
The accordion item header can also have an explanatory subtitle.

<component with-label="Subtitle" />
```
accordionItems : List (AccordionItem.Config msg)
accordionItems =
    [ AccordionItem.config "id"
        |> AccordionItem.withTitle "Title one"
        |> AccordionItem.withSubtitle "Subtitle"
        |> AccordionItem.withContent
        [ Html.div
            []
            [ Html.text "Lorem ipsum." ]
        ]
    ]
```

### Action Text
The accordion item header may also have an action text next to the arrow to help understand that the component is "openable" and "closable".

<component with-label="Action Text" />
```
itemActionText : AccordionItem.ActionText
itemActionText =
    { open = "Show more"
    , close = "Show less"
    }

accordionItems : List (AccordionItem.Config msg)
accordionItems =
    [ AccordionItem.config "id"
        |> AccordionItem.withTitle "Title one"
        |> AccordionItem.withActionText itemActionText
        |> AccordionItem.withContent
            [ Html.div
                []
                [ Html.text "Lorem ipsum." ]
            ]
    ]
```

### Addons
The accordion item header can also have two types of addons, an image and an icon.

__Please note:__ this is just an example, within an accordion use only one type of addon at a time.

<component with-label="Addons" />
```
accordionItems : List (AccordionItem.Config msg)
accordionItems =
    [ AccordionItem.config "id-one"
        |> AccordionItem.withTitle "Title one"
        |> AccordionItem.withAddon (Accordion.iconAddon IconSet.Car)
        |> AccordionItem.withContent
            [ Html.div
                []
                [ Html.text "Lorem ipsum." ]
            ]
    , AccordionItem.config "id-two"
        |> AccordionItem.withTitle "Title two"
        |> AccordionItem.withAddon (Accordion.imageAddon "../../../assets/placeholder.svg")
        |> AccordionItem.withContent
            [ Html.div
                []
                [ Html.text "Lorem ipsum." ]
            ]

    ]
```
