# @pyxis/icons
Pyxis Icons is part of Pyxis Design System, and contains all svg files representing all our icons.

Automatic _code generation_ lets us turn these icons into React components and Elm functions, by running the following command:

```sh
# In pyxis root directory
$ yarn generate:icons
```
