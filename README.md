# üß≠ Pyxis

The name "**Pyxis**" comes from a [small constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis) in the southern sky. It's the latin term for _compass_ and we chose it to indicate the path to follow for the designs of Prima.

## ‚ú® Introduction

Pyxis is our Design System which helps developers and designers to create complex UIs and UXs by relying on a solid foundations of best-practices and recognizable colors and patterns.

Pyxis modules are abstraction which help your team to quickly prototype and build experiences without relying on low-level stuff in a common way through Prima organization.

### Internal structure

_Please note that Pyxis is strongly opinionated and maintained by the Pyxis Team._

This repository takes advantage of [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and its capabilities to handle multiple repositories inside a so-called _monorepo_.

By consequence you'll find out that Pyxis is made of different sub-packages:

| Name            | Source                            | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@pyxis/scss`   | [Source](./packages/pyxis-scss)   | Core Scss and CSS module. **Mandatory usage.**                           |
| `@pyxis/elm`    | [Source](./packages/pyxis-elm)    | Elm components and live documentation via Elmbook.                       |
| `@pyxis/react`  | [Source](./packages/pyxis-react)  | React components and live documentation via Storybook.                   |
| `@pyxis/icons`  | [Source](./packages/pyxis-icons)  | Svg icon pack.                                                           |
| `@pyxis/tokens` | [Source](./packages/pyxis-tokens) | A representation of Design Tokens which define some Pyxis' core aspects. |

By following this guide you'll learn [how to install](#‚öôÔ∏è-setup) Pyxis and where to find the [documentation](#üìö-documentation) for your project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Pyxis is deployed on a [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Npm+Registry) repository with `npm` integration. By consequence you should install the [JFrog cli](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) in order to get things work.

You'll also need to ask DevOps for a JFrog Artifactory account in order to continue.

Now you want to instruct `npm` to download the packages from Prima's Artifactory registry instance. To do that follow the steps below:

1. Configure _npm_

   ```sh
   # From project root
   $ jfrog npmc

   # > Resolve dependencies from Artifactory? (y/n)?
   $ y

   # > Set Artifactory server ID [Default-Server]:
   $ Default-Server

   # > Set repository for artifacts deployment (press Tab for options):
   $ pyxis-it

   # You should now get this message. If so, the repo is actually configured.
   # > npm build config successfully created.
   ```

2. From [JFrog User Profile](https://prima.jfrog.io/ui/admin/artifactory/user_profile) generate an `api key`. This will be used to authorize your profile when pushing/pulling from JFrog.

3. In your terminal run:

   ```sh
   ## Replace <CREDENTIAL> with your api key

   curl -uadmin:<CREDENTIAL> http://prima.jfrog.io:8081/artifactory/api/npm/auth

   ## Usage example with a fake apikey of "abcdefghilmnopqrstuvz"
   ## curl -uadmin:abcdefghilmnopqrstuvz http://prima.jfrog.io:8081/artifactory/api/npm/auth
   ```

   This command will output a response like that:

   ```sh
   _auth = YWRtaW46e0RFU2VkZX1uOFRaaXh1Y0t3bHN4c2RCTVIwNjF3PT0=
   email = myemail@email.com
   always-auth = true
   ```

4. Now, open your `.npmrc` file, it should be placed in your _$HOME_. If you don't have a `.npmrc` file you can create it in your _$HOME_ folder.

   ```sh
   $ vim ~/.npmrc
   ```

5. Paste the output from point 3 into your `.npmrc` file, then add these lines to its bottom:

   ```
   ## File: .npmrc

   @pyxis:registry=https://prima.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/pyxis-it/

   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
   ```

6. You should now have an `.npmrc` file which looks like this:

   ```
   ## File: .npmrc

   always-auth=true
   _auth="a-very=very_very-long_authenthication_token="
   email=name.lastname@prima.it

   ## This line instruct npm to retrieve @pyxis packages from Artifactory.
   @pyxis:registry=https://prima.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/pyxis-it/

   ## This line is needed in order to resolve third-part dependencies from default npm registry.
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è We're aware about Artifactory's ability to handle dependencies itself acting like a shield for npm registry failures and speeding up build time. DevOps will enable this feature in a future release.

7. Save and close the file. You should now be able to use Pyxis npm modules like this:

   ```sh
   $ npm i @pyxis/scss

   # Or
   # npm i @pyxis/react
   # npm i @pyxis/icons
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è This isn't suitable for Pyxis Elm package.

8. You're now ready to use Pyxis in your application. Follow the [Documentation](#üìö-documentation) in order to learn how to use Pyxis.

## üìö Documentation

Before diving into documentation you should choose between using Pyxis' _precompiled CSS_ and Pyxis' _SCSS source_.

Infact _the use of Pyxis stylesheet is mandatory_.
You cannot do anything with Pyxis without relying on its core (_foundations & components_).

Once you chosen the solution which fits the best for your project you can go ahead with learning Pyxis.

| Package    | Live documentation            | Readme                                      | Mandatory |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **SCSS**   | [https://prima.design/]       | [Readme](./packages/pyxis-scss/README.md)   | X         |
| **Elm**    | [https://elm.prima.design/]   | [Readme](./packages/pyxis-elm/README.md)    |           |
| **React**  | [https://react.prima.design/] | [Readme](./packages/pyxis-react/README.md)  |           |
| **Icons**  | n/a                           | [Readme](./packages/pyxis-icons/README.md)  |           |
| **Tokens** | n/a                           | [Readme](./packages/pyxis-tokens/README.md) |           |

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Pyxis was built as a single repository with development simplicity in mind.

We use [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) for handling dependencies and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to manage versioning and publishing.

Run the following commands to setup your local dev environment:

```sh
# Install `yarn`, alternatives at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
$ brew install yarn

# Clone the `pyxis` repo
$ git clone git@github.com:primait/pyxis.git
$ cd pyxis

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run React live-documentation dev server
$ yarn storybook:serve

# Run Elm live-documentation dev server
$ yarn elmbook:serve
```

For more in-depth instructions, development guidelines etc., see the README files for each sub-repository.

### Icons

Pyxis also includes `@pyxis/icons`, a repository which contains all of our SVG icons.

Automatic _code generation_ lets us turn these icons into React components and Elm functions, by running the following command:

```sh
$ yarn generate:icons
```

### Design Tokens

Pyxis foundations is a set of constants derived from the design token entities.

To generate fresh tokens, run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn tokens:build
```
